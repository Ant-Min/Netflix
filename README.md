# Netflix
This is a java project I did for class in 2019 to practice JFrame mechanics

Movie.java is the class that has constructors for a movie ojbect containing title, director, and year released.

MovieTester.java was simply a test class to make sure movie was running properly.

Netflix.java is where the JFrame is coded. In the GUI, the user types the info of the movie and can either add it to the libaray or remove it if it exists already.
    The user can also clear the text boxes and sort the existing library into title alphabetical order.

Currently, any outputs the program does only outputs in the Eclipse/JGrasp console. I have not looked at this program since I submitted it in Spring 2019.
I plan to revise this program once I further my knowledge in JFrames.
